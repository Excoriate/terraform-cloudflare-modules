## Mono-repo structure


* **‚ö°Ô∏èModules**: refers to the actual module's directory. Where the `.tf` files reside. Each `subdirectory` is a module.
* **‚ö°Ô∏èExamples**: refers to the examples directory, where the examples recipes lives. These are also used for testing the infrastructure using [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/). For its specific documentation, query [this link](examples/README.md)
* **‚ö°Ô∏èTests**: refers to the tests directory, where the tests recipes lives. These are also used for testing the infrastructure using [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/). For its specific documentation, query [this link](tests/README.md)

## Developer Experience

Some tools that this repo uses:

* üß∞ Terraform ‚Äî strongly recommended the latest versions
* üß∞ Go ‚Äî justified mostly for **[Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/)**
* üß∞ [TaskFile](https://taskfile.dev/#/) ‚Äî for the automation of the tasks.
* üß∞ [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) ‚Äî for the automation of the tasks.

>**NOTE**: For automation during the development process, I use [precommit](https://pre-commit.com/), which is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. It's a great tool, and I highly recommend it. All the hooks required are installed by [this](./DevEx/scripts/hooks/install-pre-commit-hooks-deps.sh) script. It's recommended though to run it through the [TaskFile](./TaskFile.yml) task `pre-commit-init`.

To initialize your pre-commit configuration, and ensure all the hooks are installed, run the following command:

```bash
# Using taskFiles
task pc-init
# Using make
make pc-init
```

To run these hooks against all the files, you can use the following `Task` command:

```bash
# Using taskFiles
task pc-run
# Using make
make pc-run
```

## Module Versioning

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)].

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we increment the:

1. `MAJOR` version when we make incompatible changes,
2. `MINOR` version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. `PATCH` version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version

* Backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is increased. (Initial development)
* Backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is increased. (Pre-release)

>**NOTE**: The releases are automatically generated using [release-please-action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action). For more information, please refer to the [release-please-action documentation](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action)
